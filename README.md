# Automatic_README_Generator

  ## Description
  The task of this project was to use node.js to create an application that will automatically generate a README file for a project - and I have used it to generate the README you are looking at right now. At this point, I am having trouble with the License Badge & Link - but the rest of the functionality has been built out successfully.
